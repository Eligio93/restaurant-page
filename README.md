# Restaurant page

## Description of the project
In this project I had to build a basic restaurant page practicing mainly the import and export of modules in Javascript. Another crucial point was the use of the npm and webpack to bundle all files in a single directory "dist".

## Struggles point
The import export of modules was pretty easy to understando and to implement. The part where i had most struggles was undestanding how npm and wepack work together. How to load Images in the bundle and how to setup the configuration files. After being away for a while from HTML and Css i had to go back and refresh some concept of those to make the page working properly. Another thing I've noticed is the more files are getting bigger and the project get complex, the more is hard to manage all'IDs classes and variable, so I really start to realize how important is to give the right name to all of those.

## Conclusion
I had a lot of fun building this project, using HTML,CSS and Javascript,and it was so satisfying to see the final resulta as my project start to shape more like a real world project and not just study exercitations.
